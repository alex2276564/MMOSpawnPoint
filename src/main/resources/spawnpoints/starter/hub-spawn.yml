# 🏠 Hub Spawn - Replace Your Spawn Plugin!
# ================================================================
# This replaces traditional spawn plugins (like CMI, EssentialsX spawn)
#
# What this does:
# - Players joining ANY world → teleport to hub
# - Players dying in ANY world → respawn at hub
# - Works as a complete spawn system replacement
#
# 💡 Perfect for lobby-based servers or hub-centric networks!
# ================================================================

# ================================================================
# 🔧 Setup Instructions:
# 1. Change "world" to your actual hub world name
# 2. Adjust coordinates (x: 0, y: 64, z: 0) to your spawn location
# 3. Disable other spawn plugins to avoid conflicts
# 4. Test with: /msp simulate death and /msp simulate join
#
# 💡 Pro tip: This gives you much more control than basic spawn plugins!
# You can add conditions, custom messages, effects, and more.
