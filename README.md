## üîÑ How It Works

Are you still using spawn points from CMI or EssentialsX? Their spawn point systems were designed over a decade ago and haven't evolved much since. Isn't it time for something better?

Are you tired of players always respawning at the server spawn or their bed after death? Don't you think this mechanic is outdated and limiting for modern Minecraft servers?

SmartSpawnPoint revolutionizes player respawning with features like:

### üó∫Ô∏è Adventure Map & Custom Map Support

* Perfect for adventure maps and custom map experiences
* Create checkpoint-based respawn systems for challenging parkour or puzzle maps
* Design story-driven respawn experiences that enhance narrative flow
* Support for map makers who want players to respawn at specific story points rather than beds
* Ideal for escape rooms, quest maps, and linear adventure experiences where traditional respawn mechanics would break immersion

### üåç Region-Based Respawning

* Send players who die in a PvP arena directly to a spectator area
* Teleport players who die in a dungeon to a recovery zone with healing effects
* Make players who die in the wilderness respawn at random locations for added challenge

### üé≤ Weighted Random Spawns

* Create multiple possible spawn points with different probabilities
* Adjust spawn chances based on player permissions or PlaceholderAPI conditions
* Give VIP players better spawn locations with higher probability

### üë• Party System

* Allow players to form groups and respawn together
* Perfect for adventure maps, dungeons, and RPG servers
* Special "Walking Spawn Point" feature for content creators to keep their followers nearby

### üé¨ Content Creator Features

* Give your YouTubers and streamers the ability to create spawn point parties
* When they die, they respawn at their death location and act as spawn points for their followers
* Creates amazing opportunities for content creation and community engagement

### üîÑ Asynchronous Safe Location Finding

* The waiting room system prevents lag when finding safe spawn locations
* Players are temporarily teleported to a waiting area while the plugin searches for a safe location
* Perfect for random spawn points in unpredictable terrain

### üéÆ Enhanced Gameplay Experiences

* Send players to the Nether as punishment for dying in certain areas
* Create hardcore-like experiences where players respawn in completely random locations
* Design custom respawn experiences for different player ranks or achievements

### üî∞ Permission-Based Features

SmartSpawnPoint allows you to create tiered access to features based on player ranks or donation levels. Here's a complete list of permissions that you can assign in LuckPerms:

#### All Available Permissions

Copy these permissions into your LuckPerms editor (`/lp editor`) and assign them to appropriate groups:

```text
smartspawnpoint.command
smartspawnpoint.reload
smartspawnpoint.party.invite
smartspawnpoint.party.accept
smartspawnpoint.party.deny
smartspawnpoint.party.leave
smartspawnpoint.party.list
smartspawnpoint.party.remove
smartspawnpoint.party.setleader
smartspawnpoint.party.options
smartspawnpoint.party.respawnatdeath
```

#### Suggested Permission Structure

- **Basic Players** (Default tier):

  ```text
  smartspawnpoint.command
  smartspawnpoint.party.accept
  smartspawnpoint.party.deny
  smartspawnpoint.party.leave
  smartspawnpoint.party.list
  ```

- **VIP Players** (Middle tier):

  ```text
  smartspawnpoint.party.invite
  smartspawnpoint.party.remove
  smartspawnpoint.party.setleader
  smartspawnpoint.party.options
  smartspawnpoint.vip
  ```

- **Premium/Content Creators** (Top tier):

  ```text
  smartspawnpoint.party.respawnatdeath
  smartspawnpoint.premium
  ```

- **Administrators**:

  ```text
  smartspawnpoint.reload
  ```

This tiered permission system creates progression and incentives for player ranks, enhancing both gameplay and monetization opportunities for your server. Players will have a reason to upgrade their rank to access more advanced party features and spawn benefits.

You can also configure special spawn points or weighted chances in your config based on these permissions:

```yaml
# Example of VIP-only spawn point
conditions:
  permissions:
    - "smartspawnpoint.vip"

# Example of weighted chances for premium players
weight-conditions:
  - type: "permission"
    value: "smartspawnpoint.premium"
    weight: 100  # 100% chance for premium players
```

SmartSpawnPoint isn't just a spawn point plugin - it's a complete respawn management system that opens up endless possibilities for your server!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Nether and End Teleportation**: If you want to teleport players to the Nether or End dimensions, refer to the examples in the configuration. Make sure to set `require-safe: true` to avoid players spawning in dangerous locations like lava pools in the Nether or void areas in the End.

   **Recommended Y-coordinates:**
   - **Nether**: Use `min-y: 30` and `max-y: 100` to avoid spawning players on the Nether roof (y=128) or in lava lakes at bedrock level
   - **End**: Use `min-y: 50` and `max-y: 80` to prevent spawning in the void or too close to the ground where endermen might be aggressive

2. **Region Entry vs Respawn**: SmartSpawnPoint only handles player respawning after death, not entry into regions or worlds. For region entry commands, use WorldGuard flags like `entry-command` or `entry-deny`. For first-join teleportation, consider using Multiverse-Core's `firstspawnoverride` setting.

3. **Compatibility with Other Plugins**: SmartSpawnPoint can potentially work alongside respawn handling from CMI or EssentialsX if properly configured, but it's recommended to disable their respawn handling for the best experience:
    - For EssentialsX: Set `respawn-at-home: false` in the essentials config.yml
    - For CMI: Set `respawn.enabled: false` in the CMI config.yml

4. **Safe Location Finding**: The `require-safe` option should be set to `false` for known safe locations to improve performance. Only enable it when spawning in potentially dangerous areas.

5. **Waiting Room Design Considerations**: The waiting room feature is not just a temporary holding area - it's a fallback spawn location where players might remain if:

    - A safe location cannot be found within the configured timeout period
    - The server restarts during the asynchronous location search
    - An error occurs during the teleportation process

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Don't Trap Players!** For this reason, waiting rooms should be:

    - **Fully functional areas**: Players should be able to move around and interact
    - **Escape-enabled**: Include a way out (NPCs, pressure plates, portals, commands)
    - **Strategically located**: Consider placing them near cities, markets, or hubs
    - **Properly protected**: Use WorldGuard to prevent griefing or damage
    - **Well-designed**: Include basic amenities and clear signage explaining the situation

   üèôÔ∏è **Themed Integration**: On RPG servers, consider creating themed "recovery zones" that fit your lore while serving as waiting rooms. For example, a temple of healing, a traveler's respite, or a dimensional nexus.

   > If you're using SmartSpawnPoint on a large server with many regions or factions, it's a good idea to theme each waiting room to match the area the player died in.

6. **Action Execution Timing**: Actions (commands and messages) are only executed after a player has been successfully teleported to their final respawn location:
    - If using the waiting room system, actions will NOT execute while the player is in the waiting room
    - Actions will only trigger once the player reaches their actual spawn point
    - This ensures that effects, items, and messages are applied at the appropriate time

7. **Vanilla vs SmartSpawnPoint Respawn Mechanics**:
    - **Vanilla Minecraft** (without any plugins) follows a strict respawn priority:
        1. First checks for a valid respawn anchor in the Nether dimension (if properly charged with glowstone)
            - Respawn anchors only work when placed in the Nether dimension
        2. Then checks for a valid bed in the Overworld dimension (if not broken or obstructed)
            - Beds only function as spawn points when placed in the Overworld
        3. If neither exists or they're obstructed, sends player to the world spawn point (usually near coordinates 0,0 or wherever /setworldspawn was set)
        4. In the End dimension, players always return to the Overworld spawn regardless of beds or anchors

    - **SmartSpawnPoint** completely transforms this with a more flexible priority system:
        1. Region-Based Spawns ü•á (Highest Priority): Checks if player died in a configured WorldGuard region
        2. World-Based Spawns ü•à (Secondary Priority): If no region match, checks for world-specific spawn rules
        3. Fallback to Vanilla (Lowest Priority): Only if no SmartSpawnPoint rules match
        4. Party System Overrides üéâ: Can override all above rules if enabled and conditions are met
        5. Weighted Random Logic ‚öñÔ∏è: Dynamically calculates spawn probabilities based on player attributes

   **Respawn Flow Summary:**
   Player Dies ‚Üí Check Region Rules ‚Üí If match, apply region spawn ‚Üí If no match, check World Rules ‚Üí
   If match, apply world spawn ‚Üí If no match, use Vanilla Logic ‚Üí
   Party Respawn overrides all if applicable

   **Important:** For any worlds or regions not configured in SmartSpawnPoint, the plugin will automatically fall back to vanilla respawn behavior. This allows you to selectively enhance only certain areas of your server while leaving others with default mechanics.

   This enhanced flow gives server owners unprecedented control over the respawn experience while maintaining compatibility with vanilla mechanics when desired. Note that for SmartSpawnPoint to work properly, respawn handling should be disabled in other plugins like CMI or EssentialsX as mentioned in note #3.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the plugin:

1. **Check your configuration**: Validate your YAML syntax using [YAMLLint](http://www.yamllint.com/)
2. **Enable debug mode**: Set `debug-mode: true` in the config to get detailed logs
3. **Check for conflicts**: Ensure no other plugins are handling respawn events
4. **Verify dependencies**: Make sure you have the correct versions of WorldGuard and PlaceholderAPI if you're using those features
5. **Plugin conflicts**: Avoid configuring SmartSpawnPoint respawn mechanics in regions or worlds where plugins like MythicDungeons already manage respawn handling. These plugins have their own respawn systems, which can conflict with SmartSpawnPoint.

   **Party System Compatibility with Dungeon Plugins**: The SmartSpawnPoint party system may interfere with dungeon plugins' respawn mechanics (such as MythicDungeons, DungeonsXL, etc.). If you experience conflicts, disable party respawn in specific worlds or regions where dungeons exist.

   **For MythicDungeons worlds**, disable party respawn like this:
   ```yaml
   world-spawns:
     - world: "MythicDungeonWorld_0"
       type: "none"
       party-respawn-disabled: true
   ```

   **For region-based dungeon plugins**, create a WorldGuard region (make sure you set appropriate flags for your dungeon system, such as block-break permissions if needed) and configure it like this:
   ```yaml
   region-spawns:
     - region: "DungeonRegion_0"
       region-world: "DungeonWorld"
       type: "none"
       party-respawn-disabled: true
   ```

   Always test thoroughly after making these changes to ensure your dungeon systems work correctly with SmartSpawnPoint.
6. **Delayed teleportation**: If you're experiencing issues with other plugins that handle teleportation or respawning, try setting `force-delayed-teleport: true` in the config. This can help resolve timing conflicts by ensuring SmartSpawnPoint's teleportation happens after other plugins have processed the respawn event.
